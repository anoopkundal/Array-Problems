Time complexity is defined as a function of the input size n, where n indicates the magnitude of the input, while O is the growth rate function. Time complexity estimates how an algorithm performs. Time complexity simply is the count of the number of operations performed by the code.
# Array-Problems
Arrays problems are the best to understand time complexity performance. Performance detoriation becomes significant as the size of the array grows.

This project has solutions to some array problems to get an idea of the performance. 
1. Checking Duplicates in an array.
2. Reversing an array.
3. Finding a number in a sorted M x N array.
4. Replacing each element of an array with the sum of previous elements.
5. Finding a number in an array
